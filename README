You will need Vim compiled with Ruby support, then build:

% genmake make
% make
% ./install.sh

In the root of the filesystem tree you want to scan, create a .vff file.

After that, you can include or exclude files using the following statements:

[file|grep] include <pattern>
[file|grep] exclude <pattern>

You can include/exclude for just find mode or just grep mode by prefixing the
include/exclude statement with "file" or "grep". Not specifying "file" or
"grep" will cause the include/exclude to match for both.

Patterns are matched in order and short circuit on match. Unmatched files will
be excluded.

"#" is the start of a comment on any line. Blank lines are ignored.


Example:

[~/work/project] % cat .vff
include *.c
include *.cs
include *.cpp
include *.h
include *.java
include *.lua
include *.pl
include *.py
include *.rb
include *.tcl
include *.awk
include *.sed
include *.sh
include *.bash
file include *.txt
file include *.xml
text include *.foo

When you start vim, it will connect to VFFServer, and start it up if it can't.
Then you can hit ^F (find) or ^E (grep) to bring up the dialog. Start typing to
autocomplete.
